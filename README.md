# LogToHsqlDb

This app needs an argument for extraction. If you are executing from any IDE provide the full phat to the processing file. I have added an example log file in the resources directory. My local development path is as "/home/dev/github/LogToHsqlDb/src/main/resources/logfile.txt"
So I set it in my IDE as an input argument for this path. The main class is defined in **LogToHsqlDbApp** class.  Once you run the app it will generate log-data directory at the root of the application directory. After the successful execution, it will print text as "Log processing is done successfully. Please check the directory log-data."
